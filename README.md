# Daniel's *Nix Configuration

## Dependencies

- Any Linux, BSD, or Darwin distribution.
- Using the Nix package manager, flakes, and Nix home-manager.

## Notes

- This deployable environment naturally can't be completely pure*, as a password/auth 
key is needed for maintaining the repo. 

## TODO

- Use different method of Github authentication for repo maintenance.
- Make EVERYTHING pure (remove absolute paths).
